## What is Titanic survival probability prediction?

1. Titanic survival probability prediction is a tool that implies logistic regression model
to calculate the probability of survival for a passenger of Titanic on the basis 
of passenger`s personal features.
2. User may change any of 4 features utilized by the model to investigate how those could affect the probablity of
survival.
3. 4 features possible to change are: **Gender**, **Passenger Class**, **Age** and **Ticket Price**. All of those are changeable
through slider bar or radio button.
4. Tool is hosted on the shiny server, [here](http://pluzhnikovd.shinyapps.io/Ass1)

Interface divided into Left sibebar for inputs and Right sidebar for result output

## Data used
Data used for the project came out of [here](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/S/Harrell/data/descriptions/titanic.html).
Code for data load was adapted to be used on shiny server.
Data was cleaned and sampled into 70% for the model, though sampling in this version is meaningless and wasnt used.

For demonstration purpose, lets complete single prediction. We start with data preparation
```{r message=F,warning=F}
library(caret); library(dplyr)
wd.datapath = paste0(getwd(),"/Data"); 
wd.init = getwd(); 
setwd(wd.datapath)
titanic = read.csv("titanic3.csv", header = TRUE); 
setwd(wd.init)
titanic<-mutate(titanic,survived = as.factor(survived))[!is.na(titanic$age)&!is.na(titanic$fare),]

randx = 838 
set.seed(seed = randx)
in_train<-createDataPartition(y = titanic$survived,p=0.7,list=F)
train_set<-titanic[in_train,]
```

## Model and prediction
 For model used binomial glm. And for prediction we will use the same input parameters as shown on "Interface" slide:
```{r message=F,warning=F} 
model<-glm(data=train_set,survived~sex+age+pclass+fare,family = binomial(link="logit"))
newdata<-data.frame(age=25,sex="male",pclass="1st",fare=100)
```

     
And result as shown:
```{r message=F,warning=F} 
paste(round(plogis(predict(model,newdata))*100,2),"%")
```
